# Initial Populate Process ‚Äì Ekantik_QS

This folder contains all scripts needed to **initialize the database and export the frontend files** from scratch.

If the database is ever lost or reset, simply run `populateDB.py` to fully regenerate all required data.

---

## ‚úÖ What This Does

`populateDB.py` automates the full data pipeline:

1. **Fetch all videos** from the YouTube channel using the Data API
2. **Filter relevant videos** containing `#XXX` format in the title
3. **Extract questions** from video descriptions and insert into the local DB
4. **Export** the final data to `public/all.json` and `public/all_qs.json`
5. **Archive** the data snapshot to `db/db_archives/`
