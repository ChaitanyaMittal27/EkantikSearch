"""
filterRelevantVideos.py - Filters relevant videos from the list.

This script:
- Reads `backend/all_videos.txt`.
- Extracts only videos with `#XXX` in the title, where XXX is a 3-digit number.
- Saves the filtered list to `backend/filtered_videos.txt`.
- Identifies missing video numbers and checks if they exist in `all_videos.txt`.
- Saves missing results to `backend/missingafterfilter.txt`.

Output:
- `backend/filtered_videos.txt` (Filtered relevant videos).
- `backend/missingafterfilter.txt` (Missing videos check).
